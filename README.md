# A Note About the Files
There are two attempts at this project contained in this repository. The first one which is comprised of source.cpp and a std lib header file is the first attempt at this project and learning C++. I took a two year hiatus after learning some programming and to refresh myself I worked through my original projects. The revised attempt is that effort.

# Project Notes
This program takes user input and stores in a string then iterates through the characters in that string and reports any duplicate characters.
